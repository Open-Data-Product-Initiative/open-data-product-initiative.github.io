description: The Open Data Product Specification is a vendor-neutral, open-source machine-readable data product metadata model. It defines the objects and attributes as well as the structure of digital data products. Development of the standard is coordinated in Open Data Product Initiative (ODPI) which was established in July 2022 to make it possible for the specification to grow and become institutionlized. The ODPI was taken under the wings of open source chapter of Open Collective.
